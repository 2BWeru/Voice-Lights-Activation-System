Problem Statement

    Problem: We propose to develop a voice-activated light activator system. This system will allow users to control lights using voice commands, 
             enhancing convenience and accessibility. This can be beneficial for people with limited mobility or in situations where turning on
             lights manually is difficult.

Materials

    Microcontroller Board: Arduino Mega 2560 R3
    Jumper Wires
    Breadboard: Arduino Mega Protoshield V3
    Microphone Module: Sensitivity Sound Detection Sensor Module
    Bluetooth Module: Arduino Bluetooth Controller
    LED Lights: Select LEDs (quantity depends on desired lighting setup)
    Resistors: Select resistors based on LED requirements
    Power Supply: 9V DC Adapter

Installation and Usage

    Connect the microphone module, Bluetooth module, and LEDs to the Arduino Mega board following the provided schematic or wiring diagram.
    Upload the provided Arduino sketch (voice_light_activator.ino) to the Arduino Mega board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.
    Power on the Arduino Mega board using the 9V DC adapter.
    Pair the Arduino Bluetooth controller with your smartphone or other compatible device.
    Open the serial monitor or serial terminal on your computer to view the system's status and debug messages.
    Use voice commands to control the LED lights. Supported commands include:
        "on" or "all": Turns all lights on.
        "off" or "all off": Turns all lights off.
        "red" or "Red on": Turns red lights on.
        "red off": Turns red lights off.
        "green" or "green on": Turns green lights on.
        "green off": Turns green lights off.
        "blue" or "blue on": Turns blue lights on.
        "blue off": Turns blue lights off.
        "yellow" or "yellow on": Turns yellow lights on.
        "yellow off": Turns yellow lights off.
